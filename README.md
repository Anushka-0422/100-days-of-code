🌟 100 Days of MERN Stack Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of MERN Stack Developer Journey!
This journey wasn’t perfectly consistent—because of semester exams and college workload —but I still pushed myself, stayed dedicated, and completed the full 100 days.
Even though some days were missed due to academics, I always returned stronger and continued learning.
